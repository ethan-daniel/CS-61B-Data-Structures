# CS-61B-Data-Structures
This repository is not associated with official enrollment or attendance at the University of California, Berkeley.

It contains all of my self-taught work for the publicly available course CS61B Spring 2018 at UC Berkeley. 
The course has all of it's lectures, discussions, labs, homeworks, and projects open to the public in this link https://sp18.datastructur.es.
I've taught myself all of the material, and passed the autograders for all of the assignments with the exception of partially passing homework 5.

The two main takeaways from this course are that it's made me more efficient as a programmer and taught me to write more efficient programs. It is a phenomenally well put together course, and I want to thank Professor Josh Hug for helping me become a better engineer!
