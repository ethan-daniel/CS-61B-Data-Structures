All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I did not see the solution.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was proud of my ability to make the array circular, since it's intimidating to do on the surface.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Not too sure, but maybe I could have written additional helper functions for resizing in removeLast() and removeFirst() in ArrayDeque.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A: I did not speak to a partner.

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: Probably to use get() in resize() before I wrote all the spaghetti code I did in my first attempt.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I would have spent more time thinking about the functions I have given so that I could abstract away some of the complexity I faced later in optimizing the total size of my array.

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: N/A

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I was proud of my ability to make the linked lists circular.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: Not sure.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: N/A

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: Definitely understand recursion better. I was stuck on getRecursive().

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: Not sure. I had a good experience writing it.

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?
